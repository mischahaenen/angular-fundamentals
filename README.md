# 👑 Angular - Fundamentals

## 📚 Description
This project shows code samples for recommended do's for Angular. It is a collection of code samples that are designed to be used as a reference for Angular developers. The code samples are written in TypeScript and are written in a way that is easy to follow. For further information on Angular, please visit the [Angular website](https://angular.io/).

## 📝 Prerequisites
- Understanding of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML).
- An active [LTS or maintenance LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) of Node.js.
- Package manager: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

## 👩‍🔧 Installation
Install the Angular-CLI: ```npm install -g @angular/cli``` and create a new project: ```ng new my-app```

## 🏃‍♀️ Usage
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## 🤖 Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive | pipe | service | class | guard | interface | enum | module`.

## 🏠 Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## ✅ Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## ✅ Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
